This repository is purely for practice and consistent exposure to GitHub!

My name is Thomas McNulty and GitHub is awesome. I currently have one project I'm working on right now, but need to get into the habit of editing my GitHub's readme file instead of the one of PC. Which is why I created this one! 

I just LOVE DATA, like almost [if not as much] as I love making art, lifting weights, and connecting with nature. For context I've been painting/drawing/creating art for as long as I can remember, lifting weights/learning about fitness is a daily practice of meditation and has been since 2018, and of course love for nature needs no contex since its shares a consistent sense of presence and gratitude to everyone who takes the time to listen. So when I say I LOVE data I really mean it, it's a part of me just as those other three are.
